# Python-Projects
## Compilation of projects related to the Python language

- **Organic Rankine Cycle Model:** This is a model of an organic rankine cycle, which simulates being coupled to an internal combustion engine and takes advantage of the exhaust gases of these

The model programmed in the Python language determines the thermodynamic balances of the equipment involved in the ORC cycle, its associated costs and its levelized cost of energy, as well as those associated with the Motor-ORC system to analyze the viability of the implementation of the cycle. Finally, it performs an environmental impact analysis based on the current emissions of the engine and the emissions avoided by the implementation of the cycle.

**Dependencies:** Coolprop library and pandas

- **Basic own database project:** This is a basic database created with tkinter and sqlite3 to register events in the energy consume

The main goal of this project is create a machine learning model to predict events in the energy consume, more specifically, what appliance are consuming energy in a time window, this project will be created step by step and this is the first

**Dependencies:** tkinter and sqlite3
