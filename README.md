- Organic Rankine Cycle Model: This is a model of an organic rankine cycle, which simulates being coupled to an internal combustion engine and takes advantage of the exhaust gases of these

The model programmed in the Python language determines the thermodynamic balances of the equipment involved in the ORC cycle, its associated costs and its levelized cost of energy, as well as those associated with the Motor-ORC system to analyze the viability of the implementation of the cycle. ; Finally, it performs an environmental impact analysis based on the current emissions of the engine and the emissions avoided by the implementation of the cycle.
